This is a basic LSB substitution audio steganography.


The challenge description provides the following clues:
- LSB 
- 1 in every 100 bytes
- Only on channel 2
- At some point the output will likely be in Duckspeak (https://www.dcode.fr/nak-nak-duckspeak) and must be converted to plaintext.


Separate the audio channels.
On channel 2, extract the LSB of 1 in every 100 bytes. 
You will get a binary string of 1s and 0s, of total length 4920. That's divisible by 8.
ASCII characters can also be represented in binary within 8 bits.
If you convert the binary string to ascii, you get an output in duckspeak.
Convert duckspeak ciphertext into plaintext and you get your flag.
