STEP 1: Ann Elizabeth Aryeuokei on Instagram (@ann_e_aryeuokei)

- There are 2 mentions of Ann's university: 1 picture of a bird and 1 picture of her at graduation. Google Lens the bird ('rock ptarmigan') and together with the Iceland ccTLD in the graduation photo, use google dork to find an Icelandic university that publishes a lot about the bird.
	- E.g. "rock ptarmigan" university site:.is
