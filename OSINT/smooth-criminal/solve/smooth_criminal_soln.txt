This is an exercise testing several OSINT techniques relating to GAIA, Google dorking, Instagram, internet archives, WIFI network mapping, GitHub, Linkedin and Telegram. Tools in use: Sherlock, GHunt, Wigle.net, wayback.archive.org.


We begin with our only clue, and do a username search for 'ann_e_aryeuokei' using Sherlock (https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock). 


STEP 1: Ann Elizabeth Aryeuokei on Instagram (@ann_e_aryeuokei)
- Linktree in bio contains password-locked pastebin (https://linktr.ee/annaryeuokei)
- 1 tagged post from Jeanie Bill leads us to her account


STEP 2: Jeanie Bill on Instagram (@magicgeniebill)
- posts and archived stories with a lot of Ann's personal information
- 1 post about coding a present for Ann, suggests a need to visit GitHub. Several methods:
	- Search 'magicgeniebill' on github.com
	- Sherlock
	- Based on how GitHub URLs work, just append '/magicgeniebill' to the end of 'github.com'


STEP 3: Jeanie Bill on GitHub (https://github.com/magicgeniebill)
- project commit history "create password_maker.py" with half a flag in the comments: REP{4Nns_833N_H!t_bY_
- run password_maker.py, find relevant personal information to get password.
	- question #4 regarding jobs suggests to search for Ann's Linkedin
- Link in bio for telegram channel


STEP 4: LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com/in/areyeuokeianne)
- profile contains current workplace
- Post: 1 picture of a bird and 1 picture of Ann at graduation with part of her university's URL cropped out. Google Lens the bird ('rock ptarmigan') and together with the Iceland ccTLD in the graduation photo, use google dork to find an Icelandic university that publishes a lot about the bird.
	- E.g. "rock ptarmigan" university site:.is


STEP 5: Telegram channel (https://t.me/+jzNAplltAmtjN2U1)
- Video message in channel shows MAC address (aka BSSID) of Ann's Parents' house wifi router (C0:4A:00:A4:82:9C), use www.wigle.net to find its location
- Channel bio describes having been deleted but archived recently, suggests needing to find the old bio in an internet archive.
	- WayBackMachine (https://web.archive.org/web/20240830152006/https://t.me/+jzNAplltAmtjN2U1)


STEP 6: Find Jeanie and Ann's Emails 
- Jeanie's GitHub commit history "delete clue" has a clue that you can find email accounts from GitHub
- Find email from GitHub (https://www.nymeria.io/blog/how-to-manually-find-email-addresses-for-github-users)
	- iloveannaryeuokei@gmail.com and annelizabetharyeuokei@gmail.com


STEP 7: Jeanie's Google Calendar
- Can use a google OSINT tool like GHunt (https://github.com/mxrch/GHunt) or manually type Jeanie's email account into Google Calendar's 'search for people' search bar
- Find weekly Saturday scheduled meetings at Centaur Peaks between Jeanie and Ann


STEP 8: Ann's Google Calendar
- Same as step 7. Using GHunt here will be much more efficient.
- Dec 2022: Ann goes on holiday in Europe and the calendar event is shared with a throwaway account she makes for this occasion
	- europetripdec2022@gmail.com
- Dec 2022: event reminder to 'leave review' suggests need to look at google reviews.


STEP 9: Ann Throwaway's Google Reviews
There are 2 methods to access this.
- GHunt
- Manual
1. go to google chats (chat.google.com)
2. new chat -> start typing email address
3. dev tools --> network --> filter for 'autocomplete'
4. view latest entry --> response --> copy-paste 21 digit google ID
	- Google ID: 106840208602457818049
5. Get google maps profile from google ID (https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/<GOOGLE ID>)


STEP 10: Fill in Password Maker with all the Info:
- Instagram (Jeanie's)
	- Post: Ann's DOB = 20-04-2000
	- Story Highlights: Ann's Nationality = Congolese
	- Story Highlights: Ann's Favorite Holiday = Christmas 
- LinkedIn
	- Experience: Ann's workplace = Jackson 7 bank
	- 2 pictures in Post + Google Dork: Ann's university = University of Akureyri
- Telegram Channel
	- video message + Wigle.net: Ann's parents' city of residence = Nizhnevartovsk
	- Archived Profile Bio: Ann & Jeanie's city of residence = Auckland
		- Alternatively, you can get this info from Jeanie's Google Calendar. The 'police interview' event takes place in Auckland
- GitHub
	- extract email: Ann's email: annelizabetharyeuokei@gmail.com
- Google Calendar
	- Jeanie's Calendar: Ann & Jeanie visit weekly = centaur peaks
	- Ann's Calendar: Ann's throwaway account = europetrip2022dec@gmail.com
